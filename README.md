# Scala Basic


- Scala is a multi-paradigm language
- Everything in Scala is an `expression`.
- The difference between a statement and an expression is that a statement does not return an a value, while an expression does.


## Variables

In Scala you can define variables in three different way

- val (immutable variable)
- var (mutable variable)
- lazy val


## Collections Hierachy

You have to choose only one of these three types:
- Sequence
- Map
- Set

The actual decision is to choose between the mutable and immutable versions.
